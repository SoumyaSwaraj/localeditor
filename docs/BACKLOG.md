# Open items

Kept by the lead architect. Things reported by the team that are not yet assigned or fixed. Roadmap items live in `docs/ROADMAP.md`; bugs with repro steps live in `docs/QA-REPORT.md`.

## Decisions waiting for the owner
- **Background-remover weights.** Code and weights are Apache-2.0, but the training data has no clearly stated licence. Legal review before launch.
- **Compliance wording.** Pages for clinics, law firms, schools and offices say "never uploaded". They must not claim GDPR, HIPAA or FERPA compliance without legal review.
- **Replay end tag.** The "Made with LocalEditor" tag on replay videos is off by default. Turning it on by default would help reach.
- **Open source and self-hosting.** Not decided.

## Not yet assigned
- **QA-010** Convert to PDF turns Word, Markdown, HTML and PowerPoint into page pictures with no text layer. Belongs with the next PDF wave.
- **PDF wave, second half:** D11 saved form details, D14 compare versions, D15 bundle builder, D16 stamps and comment summary, D17 invoice maker, D18 tables to spreadsheet, D19 saved PDF workflows, D20 fingerprint receipt. D21 to D26 (teacher kit) are not requested yet.
- **Makers, second and third sets** (M2, M3) start when the framework merges.
- **Device support follow-ups:** when the browser table says the current browser supports something but the live test fails, say "update this browser" instead of suggesting sibling browsers on the same engine; register `/device-check/` in generated lists and the precache; each feature owner wraps its start in `LE.support.gate` and reports success or failure.
- **Version history limit.** `LE.project` prunes versions to its own count; the storage manager's "versions kept" setting cannot raise it. Needs `LE.project.setKeepCount`.
- **Background studio:** detach is approximate for blurred, dimmed or tiled backgrounds; rotation is 90° steps only; old `bgPhotos` code in the colour module is unreachable and can be deleted; pattern backgrounds could be stored as tiles instead of full-page bitmaps.
- **Collage:** catalogue templates are not tunable with the builder sliders; flipped slots pan mirrored; the index grew to 66 KB.
- **Recipes:** resize, border and text steps only run on export or batch, not live in the studio.
- **Local languages and scripts.** The font library is Latin only.

## Never verified in this build environment
Real iPhones and Android phones, Safari, Firefox, the on-screen keyboard, screen readers, the Android share sheet, real AWS (deploy, CloudFront function, headers policy), and every stock API (Pixabay, Pexels, Openverse, Unsplash are all tested against mocked responses).
